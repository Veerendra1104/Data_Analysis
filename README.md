<h2 style="color:red"> Diwali Sales Data Analysis </h2>

<h3> Project Overview </h3>
<p>
This project focuses on analyzing Diwali sales data to uncover insights into customer buying patterns, popular product categories, and regional sales performance. The analysis is conducted using two methods:

Python: Data cleaning, processing, and initial analysis using common data analysis libraries.
Power BI: Visualizing the data in an interactive dashboard for a clearer understanding of sales trends.
Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis includes historical sales data for Diwali, covering various attributes like product details, customer demographics, purchase dates, and sales values.

Objective
The primary goal is to gain insights into the following areas:

Sales trends during Diwali season.
Popular products and product categories.
Customer demographics and regional distribution of sales.
Revenue generated per region and per category.
<h2 style="color:Green"> Method 1: Data Analysis Using Python </h2>
In this approach, Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn are used for data cleaning, processing, and analysis.

Steps
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values, correcting data types, and cleaning up inconsistencies in the dataset.
Data Analysis:

Analyzing sales trends over time (e.g., increase in sales around Diwali dates).
Identifying top-performing products and categories using sales volume and revenue metrics.
Customer demographic analysis by age group, location, and purchase frequency.
Visualization:

Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create visualizations like bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.
Visuals include sales trends, product categories' revenue contribution, and demographic distribution.
Key Insights
The most popular products during Diwali are from [Category X].
Region Y shows the highest sales volume, suggesting regional popularity during festive seasons.
Majority of the customer base is aged between [Age Range].

<h2 style="color:Green"> Method 2: Data Visualization Using Power BI </h2>
In this approach, Power BI is used to create an interactive dashboard that displays key sales metrics and trends.

Power BI Steps
Data Import and Cleaning:

Importing the dataset into Power BI and handling missing values or incorrect data types.
Building Visualizations:

Sales Over Time: A line graph showing daily or weekly sales during the Diwali period.
Top Products and Categories: A bar chart for the highest-grossing products and categories.
Customer Demographics: Pie charts or tree maps representing customer age groups, genders, and regions.
Regional Performance: A map visualization showing revenue per region.
Creating Interactive Filters:

Adding filters for date range, product categories, and regions, allowing users to explore data dynamically.
Key Insights from Power BI Dashboard
[Product Category] generated the most revenue, highlighting its popularity.
[Region] recorded significantly higher sales compared to others.
Younger age groups (e.g., 20-30 years) accounted for a large portion of the customer base.
